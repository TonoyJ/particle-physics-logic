This JavaScript particle effect code dynamically creates and animates particles within an HTML canvas to produce immersive visual effects. Each particle has configurable properties such as position, velocity, size, and color, all updated using requestAnimationFrame() for smooth rendering. The logic simulates movement, collision boundaries, and interactive responses to mouse or touch eventsâ€”without relying on any external libraries or assets. Everything runs purely on native JavaScript and the Canvas API. Its modular design allows easy customization of particle density, speed, colors, and connection effects, making it perfect for responsive hero backgrounds, loaders, or dynamic UI visualizations.
